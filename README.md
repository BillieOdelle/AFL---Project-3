After examining the dataset available at the provided link, the dataset contains a wealth of information related to Australian Rules Football matches, players, teams, and seasons. 

It offers valuable insights into player performance, team strategies, and overall trends within the sport. 

We focused on:

What is the highest win between playing on your homeground compared to playing away.

DATA SOURCE:
Australian Football League (AFL) Database | Kaggle
csv files = games, players, stats

We used:
SQL pgAdmin for our database
Javascript
Plotly
HTML
D3.js
Style.css

Using this code, you can copy and paste into the required areas; however, you may need to will need to create your own database in pgAdmin to be able to run the code and have it link and run properly.

We ran queries in pgAdmin and then included the query in the python code to drive the api link and the javascript creating the charts and the html to print into a local browser page.

We were able to create an interactive dashboard.  You select a year, for the graphs to change based on the queries and the available data we imported into SQL pdAdmin.
